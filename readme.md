How to run:

-Make sure you change file path for your synonyms.csv in getTerms() method

-All 5 Models are run by default, if you want less, comment out evaluation(model_name) at the bottom
of main.py depending on what you want to run
-Make sure for your model_output.csv files, you do not have a file already named that or the
program will not work (Clear out files before each execution)
-Please Refer to 472_P3\Data for data files that were generated for the submission of this project
